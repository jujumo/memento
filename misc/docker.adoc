== Terminology

. `image` is a saved and archived machine state (like an .img of an SD card).
. `IMAGE ID` uniquely identified an image. It is 64 digit hex code truncated to 12 digits (e.g. 91c95931e552).
. `repository` is a collection of images. 'ubuntu' is a repository.
. `repository:tag` (I 'll call it `image alias`) is human-friendly alias to an `IMAGE ID`.
   The `tag` part usually refer to a version name, as such as 'hello-world:latest'
. `registry` is a server that stores and lets you distribute images.
. `container` is a running instance based (and possibly modified) on an image.
. `CONTAINER ID` uniquely identified a container.
. `NAME` is an alias to `CONTAINER ID`.

== format

You can customize the default formatting of `docker ps` command by setting the `.docker/config.json`

[source,bash]
mkdir ~/.docker && nano ~/.docker/config.json

For example:

..docker/config.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "psFormat": "table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Status}}\\t{{.RunningFor}}\\t{{.Image}}"
}
