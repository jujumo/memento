== Variables

=== reference

Use variable with the form:

- `${variable_name}`: cmake variable
- `$ENV{variable_name}`: environment variable

It works:

- in or outside quotes.
- returns empty string if the variable is not set.
- Nested are evaluated from the inside out.

=== setting

=== print all variables

get_cmake_property(_variableNames VARIABLES)
list (SORT _variableNames)
foreach (_variableName ${_variableNames})
    message(STATUS "${_variableName} ===> ${${_variableName}}")
