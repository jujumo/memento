|================================================================================================
| pattern           | Description
|  `\d` (`\D`)      | Matches any Unicode (not) decimal digit, including [0-9] and many others.
|   `\w` (`\W`)     | Matches Unicode (not) word characters.
|  `\s` (`\S`)      | Matches Unicode (not) whitespace characters ([ \t\n\r\f\v] and others
|   `.`             | Matches any character except a newline (if not flag DOTALL).
|   `^`             | Matches the start of the string.
|   `$`             | Matches the end of the string or just before the newline.
|   `*`             | Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding.
|   `+`             | Causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding.
|   `?`             | Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding.
|  `X?`             | Performs the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion. Works with `*`, `+`, `?` and   `{m,n}`
| `{m}`             | Specifies that exactly m copies of the previous.
| `{m, n}`          | Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding.
| `{m, n}?`         | Causes the resulting RE to match the fewer from m to n repetitions of the preceding.
| `\`               | Either escapes special characters
| `[]`              | Used to indicate a set of characters.
| &#124;            | match or
| `(...)`           | Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses and indicates the start and end of a group.
|`(?aiLmsux)`       | One or more letters from the set 'a', 'i', 'L', 'm', 's', 'u', 'x'.
| `(?:...)`         | A non-capturing version of regular parentheses.
| `(?P<name>...)`   | Matches is accessible via the symbolic group name name.
| `(#...)`          | Comment
| `(?=...)`         | Matches if ... matches next, but doesn’t consume any of the string
| `(?!...)`         | Matches if ... doesn’t match next. This is a negative lookahead assertion.
| `(?<=...)`        | Matches if the current position in the string is preceded by a match for ... that ends at the current position.

## Matching

|===
| method | purpose


| match()
| Determine if the RE matches at the beginning of the string.


| search()
| Scan through a string, looking for any location where this RE matches.

| findall()
| Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as a list.

| finditer()
| Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as an iterator.
|===



`match.groupdict(default=None)`` returns a dictionary containing all the named subgroups.

```python
>>> m = re.match(r"(?P<first_name>\w+) (?P<last_name>\w+)", "Malcolm Reynolds")
>>> m.groupdict()
{'first_name': 'Malcolm', 'last_name': 'Reynolds'}
```
