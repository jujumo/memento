[options="header",cols="1,6"]
|===
| keys              | action
| kbd:[ESC]kbd:[ESC]| inserts the last command with **sudo** prefix (requires sudo plugin).
| kbd:[ESC+.]       | inserts the **last argument** of the previous history line, repeat to go back in history. (Same in Bash.)
| kbd:[ESC+']       | **quotes** the whole line. (Useful for su -c or ssh).
| kbd:[ESC+q]       | clears the line and **inserts it again** on the next prompt, allowing you to issue an interim command.
| kbd:[ESC+RETURN]  | inserts a literal **newline**, so you can edit longer commands easily.
| `<(command)`      | returns the filename (in /dev/fd if supported or as a FIFO) of the pipe given by command for reading. (For example, use diff <(ruby foo.rb) <(ruby-1.9 foo.rb) to compare two program outputs).
| `cd old new`      | substitutes old with new once in the pwd and chdirs there.
| `!$`              | expands to the previous history line’s last argument, `!^` expands to the first argument, `!:n` to the n-th argument.
| `=foo`            | expands to the full path of foo in the PATH (like which foo).
| `for src (*.c) { ... }` | abbreviates  `for src in *.c do ... done` (which is actually memorizable). You can even drop the curly braces if you don’t have `;` in the command.
| `<42-69>`         | globs numbers between 42 and 69. Drop the number(s) to make it open-valued. `{42..69}` expands to the numbers between 42 and 69.
| `\***`            | expands recursively like `**`, but follows symbolic links.

== install

[source,bash]
----
$> sudo apt-get install zsh curl git
$> sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
----

NOTE: if you get an error mentioning missing `remote-https`, please refer to git section in link:../../misc/synology.adoc .

== configure plugins

The list of plugin I like:

..zshrc
[source,bash]
----
...
plugins=(
        cp
        gitfast
        common-aliases
        rsync
        debian
        sudo
        screen
        docker
)
...
----

== get my theme

[source,bash]
----
$> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jujumo/memento/main/coding/linux/jumo.zsh-theme -O ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/jumo.zsh-theme
$> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jujumo/memento/main/coding/linux/jumo.zsh-theme -o ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/jumo.zsh-theme  # or use curl if you prefer
$> . ~/.zshrc  # to reload
----

== configure kbd:[HOME] and kbd:[END] keys.

In some cases, through ssh, kbd:[HOME] and kbd:[END] does not work as expected.
Adding the following to `.zshrc` usually restore the their behavior.

..zshrc
[source,bash]
----
...
bindkey "\033[1~" beginning-of-line
bindkey "\033[4~" end-of-line

   or

bindkey  "^[[F"   end-of-line
bindkey  "^[[3~"  delete-char
----
